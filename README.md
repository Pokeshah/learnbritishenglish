# Quiz
A python app that can help you learn by quizzing you.

## How to Use

Clone this repository and then cd inside. Then run `quiz.py`. The lists are preloaded with American and British words. It gives you an American word and you have to return the British spelling of that word. 

## Customising

You can change the word lists to include any word list of your choice. `definition.txt` will be the definition, and `answer.txt` will be the answer.

If you change the file names, be sure to change them in the code.
