# Quiz
A python app that can help you learn by quizzing you.

## How to Use

Clone this repository and then cd inside. Then run `quiz.py`.

## Customising

You can change the word lists to include any word list of your choice. `defenition.txt` will be the definition, and `answer.txt` will be the answer.

If you change the file names be sure to change them in the code.
